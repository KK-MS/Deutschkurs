* In English, the `preposition` has `no effect` on the pronoun or the nounâ€™s definite or indefinite article that appear before it. You just put the appropriate preposition in first, then add the noun or pronoun, with no changes.
* In German language, `Prepositions` `can affect` which case is used for the noun or pronoun it appears in front of. Each of the prepositions can demand that the noun it precedes changes to either accusative, dative or genitive.
* Thus in German language `Prepositions` and `Cases` both to be considered to form a sentence.
